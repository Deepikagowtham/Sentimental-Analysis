### Sentiment Analysis  
**Detecting Sentiment Polarity in Tamil-English and Tulu-English Code-Mixed Text**  

Sentiment analysis involves identifying subjective opinions or emotional responses about a given topic. With the growing prevalence of social media, there is an increasing need for sentiment detection systems that can handle **code-mixed text**, especially for Dravidian languages like Tamil and Tulu. Code-mixing is a common phenomenon in multilingual communities, where languages are mixed within a single text, often written in non-native scripts. Traditional systems trained on monolingual datasets struggle to address these complexities, making this a challenging yet crucial area of research.  

To tackle this challenge, I worked on **Sentiment Analysis in Tamil-English and Tulu-English Code-Mixed Text** as part of the **DravidianLangTech@NAACL 2025 Shared Task**. This task involved classifying the sentiment polarity of YouTube comments or posts into four categories: **positive, negative, neutral, and mixed emotions**. The dataset provided was a **gold standard corpus**, with annotated text at the comment/post level, representing real-world scenarios with class imbalances.  

The goal of this task was to develop models that could understand sentiment polarity despite the complexities of code-mixed scenarios. I utilized various machine learning models such as **KNN, SVM, and Decision Tree classifiers** to train and evaluate the system. Additionally, I used **TF-IDF vectorization** to represent the textual data effectively.  

I have included the models used, training and testing datasets, and the final results obtained for Tamil and Tulu languages in this project.  

This effort has contributed to advancing research in sentiment analysis for **low-resource languages**, encouraging further innovations in handling code-mixed texts on social media.
